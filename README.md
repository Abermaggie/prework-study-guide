# Prework Study Guide- Coding Bootcamp Edition

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an online study guide that is clear and concise but holds relevant information for any Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp student that is needing direction and information while moving through this course's prework.  In addition, the motivation for creating this application was to provide a resource for basic coding information that might need to be reviewed before beginning any future projects.

This project provides a 'one-stop shop' for the 3 modules of information provided in the pre-work lessons and was the author's platform for learning the foundations of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to use in upcoming projects for this bootcamp.
